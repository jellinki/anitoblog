**Day 1 (03.04.2024)**  
Today, we began setting up our blogs again for the new trimester. I reformatted the CSP page into a new trimester page.  

**Day 2 (03.05.2024)**  
Today, we started working with SASS, which is another style similar to .css. I'm excited to get to work on new stuff.  

**Day 3 (03.06.2024)**  
Today, we kept updating our blogs.  

**Day 4 (03.07.2024)**  
Today, we're going to start working on debugging. I also changed the header of the button for my CSSEPT2 because I realized that I needed to change the title, since we're not in CSP. I've also been trying to fix the Mario Animation, but it's weird; I can't figure out how to change the key event listeners to make it so Mario only puffs when you press the down key instead of the back key. Instead, Mario just breaks by turning big and doesn't move, so I reverted it back to the original and I'll try to fix it more going forward.  

Never mind, I figured it out. All I have to do is edit the actual "Arrow(Direction)" values. I had been messing with the clientX and clientYs earlier, so that's why they weren't working. Mario now Cheers on left key, Puffs on down key, Walks/Runs on right key, and Flips on the up key. Nice!  

**Day 5 (03.08.2024)**  
Today, we did well on our review; we just needed to update ourselves a bit on debugging. Our team member's machine wasn't working, though, so we'll have to help him out next week.
