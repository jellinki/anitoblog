**Weekend (03.09.2024-03.10.2024)**  
I was celebrating my mom's (and Yoongi's) birthday this weekend, so I didn't really do anything to my blog.  

**Day 6 (03.11.2024)**  
Today, I want to try and make my blog a little more creative.  

**Day 7 (03.12.2024)**  
Today, I was thinking of how I'd like to change the Mario game. I guess it's helpful to label the monsters, but it sometimes makes it clunky.  

**Day 8 (03.13.2024)**  
I didn't do much today either besides update this blog. I honestly feel kind of stressed with college admissions.  

**Day 9 (03.14.2024)**  
Today, I'm going to integrate the code from Mr. Mortensen's blog with the game. 

Update: Wow! I am not doing that again without guidance. It did a lot of things like change my font into something unreadable, destroy my navbar, remove my posts, etc. I'll try again with someone else. I ended up having to use "git reset --hard 35ea7c4" because reverting it wasn't working and neither was rebasing it. However, here are some things I'd like to fix once I get it work.  

- Remove facts from the playscreen, as it obstructs player vision.  
- Add directional jumping rather than plain vertical. This can be achieved through a wider range of sprite animations.  
- Only make Mario change sprites (ex: Mr. Lopez, monkey) when he touches a power-up, so it isn't as random and inexplicable.  

I do like the Multiplayer function in the game. However, I wonder if this will obstruct some of the coding I'll be trying to do, since my machine isn't the one actually hosting the game, right? Will my changes have to be on everyone else's machine too? Or will I have to remove the Multiplayer mechanism?
