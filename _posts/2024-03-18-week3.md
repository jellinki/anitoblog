**Weekend (03.16.2024-03.17.2024)**  
I was at Science Olympiad, so I didn't update my blog. We got 2nd place in the region!  

**Day 10 (03.11.2024)**  
Today, I started the different blog because I needed to change the entire theme into Minima. Everything is a little raw now, but at least the game is up and running! I also changed it from a fun facts page to a hints page because I think it's more relevant to the game.
