**Weekend (03.16.2024-03.17.2024)**  
I was at Science Olympiad, so I didn't update my blog. We got 2nd place in the region!  

**Day 10 (03.18.2024)**  
Today, I started the different blog because I needed to change the entire theme into Minima. Everything is a little raw now, but at least the game is up and running! I also changed it from a fun facts page to a hints page because I think it's more relevant to the game.  

**Day 11 (03.19.2024)**  
Today is my dad's birthday! I'm going to keep trying to mess with the font colors of my blog and such so I can make it more personal.  

Update: I was able to successfully change the color of the background and some of the text. I'm going to keep this grey for now so it's legible for sure, but I'll change it later so it fits in more with my new theme. I'm trying to make the headers on my homepage (index.md) appear with their own personal backgrounds as well as on the left so I can put an image of some sort on the right, but it isn't working. The "contact" part keeps appearing on the right no matter how many times I try to float it on the left, but I don't know how to do that. I'll ask Mya about it.  

**Day 12 (03.20.2024)**  
Today, we were able to get into our new group and establish a repo. This is going to be our new group project, so I'm pretty excited!  

**Day 13 (03.21.2024)**  
Today, we're just going to be playing around and experimenting to learn more things. I'm kind of curious about being able to put sound on my blog, but I don't really have the files for the songs I want to upload. I wonder if I can provide hyperlinks or something?  

**Day 14 (03.22.2024)**  
Today, I'm going to git pull for our team repository and get the changes Mya made.  

Update: Alright, after some debugging and clearing it with everyone in our team, we've made some edits to the Leaderboard. These were mainly frontend edits since the actual backend is a bit tricky, but we did get them done.
