**Weekend (03.23.2024-03.24.2024)**  
Alright, I didn't really do anything because I had a few religious obligations over the weekend.  

**Day 15 (03.25.2024)**  
Today, we're going to start planning on possibly fixing up the rankings so that there's images that stick to the top 3.  

Some questions that I have about our code:  
- How can we implement more precise collision detection algorithms for when the player is standing on something/interacting with it?
- On this note, how can we clean it up so it actually looks like the player is interacting with it?
- How could we use object pooling to add more enemies?
- Could we use texture atlasing to make the game run smoother?
