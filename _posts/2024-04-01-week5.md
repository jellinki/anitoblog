**Weekend (03.30.2024-03.31.2024)**  
This weekend, I went on the senior Disney trip and celebrated Easter with my family. We went and got hotpot at Liuyishou, and it was really good! Their duck broth, iced fruit tea, and matcha soft serve is out of this world. I almost died.  

**Day 20 (04.01.2024)**  
Happy April Fools! The new TXT album came out today, too, so I stayed up for that because it dropped at 2am. Because of that, I'm pretty sleepy. Today, we're going to start working on the CSS and really get on the tasks that we assigned ourselves in the issues.  

**Day 21 (04.02.2024)**  
Today, we're trying to customize the theme buttons.  

**Day 22 (04.03.2024)**  
This morning, I did my extra credit for CS! It was a lot of fun performing selection sort as a murder mystery.  

**Day 23 (04.04.2024)**  
4 4! Today, I experimented with sprite animation. I found out that if you change length and width, you're not actually changing the size of the sprite but altering the size of the window that it takes the sprites from on the spritesheet. The actual function that did what I wanted was the size ratio feature. With this, I made the monkey bigger.  

**Day 24 (04.05.2024)**  
Today, we're not really doing anything again, which I'm glad for because I feel really tired and drowsy and I kind of want to go to bed with food. Mya also isn't here, so nothing interesting is happening. Um, I might just update this blog and sign off until next next week; the oncoming spring break has me completely locked out. But I'll be really happy about next week because I can finally catch up on sleep and eat stuff that isn't crusty cafeteria food!
