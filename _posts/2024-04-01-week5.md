**Weekend (03.30.2024-03.31.2024)**  
This weekend, I went on the senior Disney trip and celebrated Easter with my family. We went and got hotpot at Liuyishou, and it was really good! Their duck broth, iced fruit tea, and matcha soft serve is out of this world. I almost died.  

**Day 20 (04.01.2024)**  
Happy April Fools! The new TXT album came out today, too, so I stayed up for that because it dropped at 2am. Because of that, I'm pretty sleepy. Today, we're going to start working on the CSS and really get on the tasks that we assigned ourselves in the issues.  

**Day 21 (04.02.2024)**  
Today, we're trying to customize the theme buttons.
