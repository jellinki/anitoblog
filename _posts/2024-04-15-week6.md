**Weekend (04.13.2024-04.14.2024)**  
This weekend, I enjoyed the last of Spring Break. My Lola came over from England for "vacationing" and we also celebrated my little brother's birthday on the 12th! He's 14 now.  

**Day 25 (04.15.2024)**  
Back at school today and STILL locked out because I don't want to be here. I do not hate this class specifically, I would just prefer to be back in my room as of right now. Today, we might do some work on the theme-changing button. The button shows up, but nothing happens when you click it.
