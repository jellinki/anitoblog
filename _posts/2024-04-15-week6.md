**Weekend (04.13.2024-04.14.2024)**  
This weekend, I enjoyed the last of Spring Break. My Lola came over from England for "vacationing" and we also celebrated my little brother's birthday on the 12th! He's 14 now.  

**Day 25 (04.15.2024)**  
Back at school today and STILL locked out because I don't want to be here. I do not hate this class specifically, I would just prefer to be back in my room as of right now. Today, we might do some work on the theme-changing button. The button shows up, but nothing happens when you click it.  

**Day 26 (04.16.2024)**  
Today, I'm trying to git pull to our platformer, but it isn't letting me and keeps saying that the files are divergent. I'll have to find a way to fix this ;-; AAUAUURGHHHGH  

**Day 27 (04.17.2024)**  
Today, I'm going to be taking notes. Apparently the weird git pull error happened to some other people in my group too, so we're just trying to figure that out. It's saying that I have to commit in order to merge the divergent files, but I don't want that to happen. Something weird also happened where the sass we worked on for Leaderboard.js just completely disappeared; we can't even find the light mode.
