**Weekend (04.20.2024-04.21.2024)**  
This weekend, I didn't code because I was in LA and Santa Monica. It was fun!  

**Day 30 (04.22.2024)**  
The weekend has officially rejuvenated me! Sort of! Today, I added functions to change the color of your name because I thought the plain color was a bit boring. I also added a noirio file to make Mario black and white, but the game wouldn't run with the code, so I deleted it. I'll keep working at it.  

**Day 31 (04.23.2024)**  
Today, I resubmitted my Mira Costa application for Spring 2024 instead of Fall 2024 like I had on my first application. I tried to work noirio, but I couldn't figure it out.  

**Day 32 (04.24.2024)**  
Today, I'm going to update chat a little more.  

**Day 33 (04.25.2024)**  
Today, I am undergoing a spiral.
