**Weekend (04.27.2024-04.28.2024)**  
This weekend, I didn't code because I was busy. I hung out with my friends and we baked cake and pizza!  

**Day 35 (04.29.2024)**  
SEVENTEEN's last album before enlistment dropped today, and its title track had a really great music video!  

**Day 36 (04.30.2024)**  
Alright, today, I think I'm gonna work a bit on my issue. (I need to type something so that I'm actually making progress.)  

**Day 37 (05.01.2024)**  
Today, we presented our features to Mr. Mortensen. He liked them :)  

**Day 38 (05.02.2024)**  
Today, I changed the glow effect to blue and I put it on the Mushroom; however, the glow only appeared as a square and not the actual curvy shape of the sprite. Because of this, I moved the glow effect to the Block Platform. I might have to make a new .js file for blocks, though, so that it doesn't affect everyone's blocks.  

**Day 39 (05.03.2024)**  
Ok, so I was planning on presenting at the Team Teach, but we're pushing it to Monday, so I'm just gonna be bing chilling for the rest of this period. Happy Friday!
