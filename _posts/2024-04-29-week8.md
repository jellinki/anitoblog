**Weekend (04.27.2024-04.28.2024)**  
This weekend, I didn't code because I was busy. I hung out with my friends and we baked cake and pizza!  

**Day 35 (04.29.2024)**  
SEVENTEEN's last album before enlistment dropped today, and its title track had a really great music video!  

**Day 36 (04.30.2024)**  
Alright, today, I think I'm gonna work a bit on my issue. (I need to type something so that I'm actually making progress.)  

**Day 37 (05.01.2024)**  
Today, we presented our features to Mr. Mortensen. He liked them :)
