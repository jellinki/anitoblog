**Weekend (05.11.2024-05.12.2024)**  
This weekend, I did a lot of work for other classes, but I didn't have time to code. Sob emoji.  

**Day 42 (05.13.2024)**  
Today, ENHYPEN's new album dropped! I think that this is one of their best ones yet.  

**Day 43 (05.14.2024)**  
Today, I fixed the GlowBlock so that it only affects the "Hills" map.  

**Day 44 (05.15.2024)**  
Alright, I gotta come up with something cool today.  

Update: I added a feature where the Goomba now explodes if you kill it. Before, it used to just turn flat, but now it shatters into a bunch of Goomba-flavored cubes. Nice!  

**Day 45 (05.16.2024)**  
Okay, so today, someone in our team broke the code, so the game isn't working. It's okay though.  

**Day 46 (05.16.2024)**  
Today, I'll keep on trying to add features.
