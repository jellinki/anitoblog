**Weekend (05.25.2024-27.2024)**  
This weekend, I enjoyed Memorial Day!

**Day 52 (05.28.2024)**  
Today, I have to lock in because I have a lot of work to do. 

**Day 53 (05.29.2024)**  
Today, I slept at 5 am so I am unhappy. However, it could be a lot worse, since today was (thankfully) a Wednesday, so I was able to sleep in. Night of the Museum is tonight!  

**Day 54 (05.30.2024)**
